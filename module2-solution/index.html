            <div>
                <p>
                    Avocados are a great source of vitamins C, E, K, and B-6, 
                    as well as riboflavin, niacin, folate, pantothenic acid, magnesium, and potassium. 
                    They also provide lutein, beta-carotene, and omega-3 fatty acids. 
                    Although most of the calories in an avocado come from fat, don't shy away!

            <div>
                <p>
                    Yams are nutrient-dense tuber vegetables that come in many colors. 
                    They're a great source of fiber, potassium, manganese, copper, and antioxidants. 
                    Yams are linked to various health benefits and may boost brain health, 
                    reduce inflammation, and improve blood sugar control.

            <h2 class='radish'>Radish</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Radishes are high in potassium, which can help lower your blood pressure. 
                    They also support the generation of collagen, which helps keep blood vessels healthy. 
                    Radishes are also thought to control damage to red blood cells and help increase oxygen supply to the blood.
